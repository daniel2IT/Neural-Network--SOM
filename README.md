# Neural-Network--SOM
A self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using
unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation 
of the input space of the training samples, called a map, and is therefore a method to do dimensionality reduction. 
Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to
error-correction learning (such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood
function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
